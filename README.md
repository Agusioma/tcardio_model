# tcardio-model
This is a model for heart attack prediction. It uses Scikit-Learn for data preprocessing and train-test split. TensorFlow was used to train it. It uses MultiLayer Perceptron(MLP) and a sigmoid activation function since this is just simple tabular data. At the end, itis converted to TfLite foruse in a WearOS app. More details to come in a few.
